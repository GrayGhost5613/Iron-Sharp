# IronSharp ecommerce store
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### It has always been a dream for me to create a online store for my soccar team ,and through CS50 my dream has become a reality. 
I built a web application using Flask. 
For managing the products data, I chose SQLite3 as it is an easy-to-use database. 
To make the website visually attractive  I applied HTML and CSS for the design and styling.
When a user visits my website they're first taken to the homepage, where all the products are displayed. 
These products are fetched from the 'products' table in the IronSharp database. 
The website has a navigation bar that lets users easily switch between the homepage, the about page, and the cart.
